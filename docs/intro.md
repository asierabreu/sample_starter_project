# IntelliTools: Starter Learning Framework

Welcome to the The _Starter_ level Learnign Framework. This documentation helps you understand what type of delivery you should expect from this project.

## The project workflow
 
  1. Initial kick-off chat to understand the context of your problem , your goal and any time constrains you may have.
  2. I provide an estimate of the involved work to you and start working on the implementation.
  3. A revision chat is agreed where I present and explain you the work performed and results.
  4. I provide the project deliverables (see below).
  5. We conclude the project with a final 'sign-off' chat.  

  *Iterative workflow:* should you need more revisions (please see prices) we do further iterations (steps 1 to 3).    

## The project deliverables

The output of the project would (typically) be :

  1. A Jupyter notebook or Python code file (.ipynb or .py format).
  2. A user manual document (pdf,docx) file with overview instructions on how to execute the provided code.

## Communication

  - Initial communication via Upwork communication channels
  - Any other preferred channels also : Zoom or else.

## Feedback (Please!)

Feedback helps consolidating my professional image so ... as usual is very much appreciated!!
