# Starter Learning Framework

Welcome to IntelliTools _Starter_ Learning Framework. This documentation helps you understand what type of delivery you should expect from this project.

## The project workflow
 
```{note}
Initial kick-off chat to understand the context of your problem , your goal and any time constrains you may have.
```

  1. I provide an estimate of the involved work to you and start working on the implementation.
  2. A revision chat is agreed where I present and explain you the work performed and results.
  3. I provide the project deliverables (see below).
  
```{note}
We conclude the project with a final 'sign-off' chat. 
```

  *Iterative workflow:* should you need more revisions we do further iterations (steps 1 to 3).    

## The project deliverables

The output of the project would (typically) be :

  1. A Jupyter notebook or Python code file (.ipynb or .py format).
  2. A user manual document (pdf,docx) file with overview instructions on how to execute the provided code.

## The timescales

Every iteration of this project will consist of 3 working weeks (15 work days) 

## Communication
